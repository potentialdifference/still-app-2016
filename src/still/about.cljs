(def captions {:one "Vivian Maier was born in 1926 in New York City into abject poverty and unhappy family circumstances. She earned her living in Chicago caring for the children of others- while secretly taking extraordinary photographs in her spare time. \n"
               :two "  Maier kept her photographic skills a virtual secret- never exhibiting, rarely sharing her pictures with her employers or her few friends; even more astonishingly, she never developed the vast majority of her photographs. \n"
               :three "As Maier never developed the vast majority of her photographs, she collected a huge number of rolls of film over the decades, and paid for them to be kept in storage.\n"
               :four "In the months before her death in 2009, living alone and virtually penniless, Maier stopped making payments to the storage company where her rolls of film were kept, and, consequently, her tens of thousands of undeveloped rolls of film, together with all her worldly possessions, were auctioned off. \n "
               :five "By a stroke of pure luck, Maier's undeveloped rolls of film fell into the hands of men who realised their immense worth; saved from obscurity, Maier's photographs now grace exhibitions and engage admirers around the globe, and the reclusive Nanny Photographer finally has the fame she deserves. \n"
               :six "Maier gave up riding her scooter when she realised she needed a licence to drive on the road; she considered having to give her name to the authorities to be an invasion of privacy. \n"})
